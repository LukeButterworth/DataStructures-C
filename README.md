# Data Structures in C

## Notes to Self
As C is not an oop, it lacks generic functionality within its compiled code
Instead, macros seem to provide the ability to define sections of code that can receive injected types

It seems worthwhile to take some time to better understand macros in C so that I can more effectively develop in the languge.
